## Communication

### Open Calendar Policy

You're welcome to book meeting time with me at any point on my calendar that's in my working hours and free. If you need to book time that's early, late, or already booked, please reach out to me first.

### DiSC

DiSC is a self-assessment that measures how an individual prefers/tends to interact with others. I've taken the DiSC assessment multiple times and always end up as a High-D, High-C, which is what DiSC calls the Creative Pattern. Here's a quick summary taken from [DiSC Mastery](http://www.discmastery.com/pdfs/DISC360%20vs%20Inscape%2015%20Patterns.pdf):

#### Creative Pattern
* **Basic Style Characteristics**: A drive toward aggression and assertiveness is softened a bit by an internal sensitivity.
* **Work Style Characteristics**: Motivated toward a freedom and flexibility to investigate and reexamine results and conclusions.
* **Primary Strengths**: Strong agent of change.
* **Ideal Job Culture**: Power and authority to make decisions and create change.
* **Needs for Increased Effectiveness**: May need help in reaching closure on decisions or projects, but may view offers to help as being intrusive.
* **Wants for Long-Term Motivation**: Authority equal to the responsibility he/she has been given.
* **Communication DOs (for others)**: Three rules: Be brief, be bright, and be gone.
* **Continuous Improvement Homework**:  May overuse bluntness, critical comments, and attitude of aloofness.

A few years ago, I had the opportunity to really work on my "homework" from above with an executive coach and continue to work on my brusqueness with a variety of tools. Feedback around this area is especially appreciated!

### Email

I have a tendency to skim long emails and similar documents. If you could include a TL;DR or BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front), I'd really appreciate it!
